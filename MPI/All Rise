your honor please , gotta believe what i say,
what i will tell you , happen just the other day 
I must confess , coz I have had about enough,
I need your help, gotta make this here thing stop 

Baby I swear I will tell the truth 
Bad all the things we used to do
If if you thought you had me fooled 
I am telling you now objection over ruled

Oh Baby,

One for the money and the free rides 
two for the lie that you denied 
All Rise , All Rise 
Three for the coz you have been making it 
four all the time you have been faking
All Rise, All Rise

So stand back, coz you dont know this cat
I have noted it down back, you dont want me to react 
I lay low , keeping all my options open , d-d decision of the jurie has not been spoken
step in my house, You know your stuff is gone,
But in reality whom did that stuff belong
I will bring you into court , psh-psh-psh to preach my order
and you know that you have to step the border.. aha
